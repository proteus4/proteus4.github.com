Five days ago, I wrote about first installing Tor and how it quickly changed my thoughts about anonymity and privacy on the Internet.

I mentioned that I had wiped one of my PCs and just reinstalled Linux on it when I noticed Tor in the available software. I installed it, began playing around with it, and felt a weird "freedom" knowing that I was, at the time, completely anonymous on the Internet.

Since that time, I've dived into Tor and the "darknet" head first. I took that PC and configured it so that any data traffic went over the Tor network. I also decided to completely separate my "anonymous" activites and my "non-anonymous" activities. It doesn't make sense to mix the two on the same computer as that would greatly reduce my anonymity. For my regular online activites &#8212; e-mail, IRC, social networking, etc. &#8212; I continue to use my MacBook Pro. For everything else, however, I switched to using my "Tor PC".

Then, a thought occured to me: <em>What if I want to be anonymous when I'm not at home?</em>

To make a long story short, I went and bought a new laptop. A little drastic, perhaps, but I think it demonstrates just how I excited I am over this "new" (to me) technology.

I brought it home and immediately replaced the straight-from-the-factory Windows installation with a custom Linux installation. I installed a graphical desktop environment and all the tools I need &#8212; and then I set up Tor.

I've been using the new laptop almost exclusively the last couple of days (other than checking my e-mail for work and &#8212; of course &#8212; Facebook) and it just seems so damn cool. Most of the time these last few days has been spent reading up on Tor, as well as anonymity, privacy, and security (and how to preserve all three).

A great deal of time has been invested ensuring that no "DNS Leakage" occurs, as that seems to be one of the biggest concerns when using Tor. Next up, I'll be spending some time configuring the firewall on this laptop to only permit outbound traffic that is going over either Tor or my VPN service.

I've already got an e-mail set up (completely anonymously), set up this blog (completely anonymously), and began participating on new IRC networks and channels (completely anonymously). It's almost like I'm living a double life.

I like it.
