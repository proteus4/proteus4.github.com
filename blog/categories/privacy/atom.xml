    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last few days I have suddenly become obsessed with anonymity.</p>

<p>I had just wiped out my last installation of Microsoft Windows and replaced it with Debian and was installing various software packages when I noticed <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> in the list. I had first heard about tor many, many years ago but had never actually gotten around to trying it out. I decided to change that.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying that I don't do anything on the internet that <em>requires</em> that I be anonymous. I don't have any compelling reason to hide anything that I do. I'm actually very <em>public</em> on the Internet. My primary blog and Twitter account have RSS subscribers and followers that number in the four digits and they're both under my real name.</p>

<p>Something I noticed, however, was that I felt some sort of innate "freedom" when I was surfing the web over Tor. I wasn't signed into my any of my Google accounts so they weren't tracking my searches. Every 15 minutes or so, I'd close my web browser and fire it back up again &#8212; wiping out my cache and cookies &#8212; so advertisers weren't tracking me across web sites either.</p>

<p>It was a weird feeling and I liked it.</p>

<p>In the days since, I've became accustomed to this freedom. Although I still use Chrome on my MacBook Pro for most of my web browsing, I've began using this Linux box more and more for my "general surfing". It's somewhat comforting to know that, regardless of what web sites I visit, no one knows who I am.</p>

<p>Tor is now configured to start up automatically when my system boots, Firefox is configured to use it as a proxy, and 95% of my web browsing is now completely anonymous. Because Tor does slow things down quite a bit, I also have chrome installed. It's only being used in a very few instances, however.</p>

<p>Over the next few posts, I'll explain how this newfound privacy has changed my "Internet habits" and caused me to seek out even more ways to be anonymous on the Internet, from e-mail to IRC.</p>

<p>It's a completely different experience and, unfortunately, it hasn't been entirely without incident.</p>
