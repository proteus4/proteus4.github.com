    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The last few days I have suddenly become obsessed with anonymity.</p>

<p>I had just wiped out my last installation of Microsoft Windows and replaced it with Debian and was installing various software packages when I noticed <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> in the list. I had first heard about tor many, many years ago but had never actually gotten around to trying it out. I decided to change that.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying that I don&#8217;t do anything on the internet that <em>requires</em> that I be anonymous. I don&#8217;t have any compelling reason to hide anything that I do. I&#8217;m actually very <em>public</em> on the Internet. My primary blog and Twitter account have RSS subscribers and followers that number in the four digits and they&#8217;re both under my real name.</p>

<p>Something I noticed, however, was that I felt some sort of innate &#8220;freedom&#8221; when I was surfing the web over Tor. I wasn&#8217;t signed into my any of my Google accounts so they weren&#8217;t tracking my searches. Every 15 minutes or so, I&#8217;d close my web browser and fire it back up again &#8212; wiping out my cache and cookies &#8212; so advertisers weren&#8217;t tracking me across web sites either.</p>

<p>It was a weird feeling and I liked it.</p>

<p>In the days since, I&#8217;ve became accustomed to this freedom. Although I still use Chrome on my MacBook Pro for most of my web browsing, I&#8217;ve began using this Linux box more and more for my &#8220;general surfing&#8221;. It&#8217;s somewhat comforting to know that, regardless of what web sites I visit, no one knows who I am.</p>

<p>Tor is now configured to start up automatically when my system boots, Firefox is configured to use it as a proxy, and 95% of my web browsing is now completely anonymous. Because Tor does slow things down quite a bit, I also have chrome installed. It&#8217;s only being used in a very few instances, however.</p>

<p>Over the next few posts, I&#8217;ll explain how this newfound privacy has changed my &#8220;Internet habits&#8221; and caused me to seek out even more ways to be anonymous on the Internet, from e-mail to IRC.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a completely different experience and, unfortunately, it hasn&#8217;t been entirely without incident.</p>
