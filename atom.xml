    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>the last few days i have suddenly become obsessed with anonymity.</p>

<p>i had just wiped out my last windows installation with debian and was installing various software packages when i noticed <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">tor</a> in the list. i first heard about tor many, many years ago but i had never actually made use of it. i decided to check it out.</p>

<p>let me say that i don&#8217;t do anything on the internet that <em>requires</em> that i be anonymous on the internet. i don&#8217;t have any compelling reason to hide anything that i do. in actuality, i&#8217;m very <em>public</em> on the internet. my primary blog and twitter account have rss subscribers and followers that number in the four digits.</p>

<p>something i noticed, however, was that i felt some innate &#8220;freedom&#8221; when i was surfing the web over tor. i wasn&#8217;t signed into my any of my google accounts, so they weren&#8217;t tracking my searches. every 15 minutes or so, i&#8217;d close my browser and fire it up again, wiping out any cache and cookies, so advertisers weren&#8217;t tracking me across sites either.</p>

<p>it was a weird feeling and i liked it.</p>

<p>in the days since, i&#8217;ve became accustomed to this freedom. although i still use chrome on my macbook pro for most of my web browsing, i&#8217;ve began using this linux box more and more for my &#8220;general surfing&#8221;. it&#8217;s somewhat comforting to know that, regardless of what sites i visit, no one knows who i am.</p>

<p>tor is now configured to start up automatically when my system boots up, firefox is configured to use it as a proxy, and 95% of my web browsing is now completely anonymous. because tor slows things down quite a bit, i also have chrome installed. it&#8217;s only being used in a very few instances, however.</p>

<p>over the next few posts, i&#8217;ll explain how this newfound privacy has changed my &#8220;internet habits&#8221; and caused me to seek out even more ways to be anonymous on the internet, from e-mail to irc.</p>

<p>it&#8217;s a completely different experience and, unfortunately, it hasn&#8217;t been entirely without incident.</p>
